# ICS4U-ISP-TweetyBotV2-Rescue-
This is a continuation of the tweetybot project, which became plagued by several files that prevented reverting to previous commits.

Using This application is fairly simple, it has all of it's dependencies onboard so there's no stress there.
To launch TweetyBot, you will need to have a browser running in the background for convenience, and then just hit run on the project. Currently, the app will open a new tab in your browser and request you log into my twitter account and authenticate the app. Once this is done, it will pull all of Alex Forgay's last 500 timeline posts into a dictionary, and then create an order 2 markov chain. Using this markov chain, the app will then generate a tweet to be posted to my twitter account. Unfortunately the one aspect of the app that is not functional is posting, so if you would like to view the tweet, you may do so in the debugger console. While viewing the tweet you will also notice that it idicates a failure on post, which is the part I can't figure out how to fix.

In any case, the app still generates some fairly amusing imitations of Alex Forgay's politically charged and baseball fuelled twitter personality. Hope you enjoy!

My Twitter Login Credentials can be requested via email in order to try out the app.
